# All is Counted

## Task

1. Create a page that would display the number of times the user clicked on it. It will start by displaying `0`, after the first click anywhere on the page it will replace `0` with `1`, after another click it will show `2` and so on.

2. Modify the counter so that it does not reset if the user _refreshes_ the page: after each refresh, the initial number of clicks the user sees is the number of times he has already clicked on the page. The counter then increases by 1 upon every click, just as it did before. The counter, however, _should reset_ to `0` after the page is closed and reopened.
